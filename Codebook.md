Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - Codebook for run_analysis.R
======================================================================

Background
-----------

This codebook contains information about the code, data and output of the run_analysis script.
Thanks to David Hood for providing some good advice and tips in his FAQ on how to approach the project.
His FAQ can be [found here] (https://class.coursera.org/getdata-009/forum/thread?thread_id=58#post-177)


Input Data Files
----------------

The data can be found at [this location] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
Once downloaded and unzipped, the following files were used as part of this project:

test folder:
* x_test.txt (test data-set with 561 features that represents the smartphone sensor output)
* y_test.txt (activity labels data-set with 1 feature representing the type of activity 1-6)
* subject_test.txt (test subjects data-set with 1 feature representing the person performing the activity)
	
train folder:
* x_train.txt (train data-set with 561 features that represents the smartphone sensor output)
* y_train.txt (activity labels data-set with 1 feature representing the type of activity 1-6)
* subject_train.txt (train subjects data-set with 1 feature representing the person performing the activity)
	
root folder:
* features.txt (this file contains 561 observations which are the names of the features in the test and train data-sets)
* activity_labels.txt (lookup of activity labels to names: 1=walking, 2=walking upstairs, 3=walking downstairs, 4=sitting, 5=stading, 6=laying)
