Calculating Averages From Sensor Data
-------------------------------------

The goal of this effort is to produce a single output file from a series of different input files containing smartphone sensor data. The sensor data was gathered from various users as they were performing one of six different activities.  The output file calculates the average per variable per person for the actvities that were measured.

The following steps were performed to calculate the average per variable per person per activity:

1. Combine Input Files (Pre-Processing Step #1):

	* The two input data-sets provided consisted of "test" data and "train" data.  
	* Within each category (test and train), there are data from smartphone sensors, data from the activity performed and data related to the subject performing the action
	* The data-sets were combined to create an inclusive data-set of sensor data, user data and activity data
	* The combined data-set consisted of 563 variables and xxx observations

2. Narrow the Focus to Average & Standard Deviation Columns (Pre-Processing Step #2):

	* The combined data-set contained 561 sensor reading variables.
	* The purpose of the study was to only focus on 57 of those sensor reading variables that related to the mean and standard deviation measurements.  
	* The combined data-set was then trimmed to only focus on those variables measuring standard deviation and mean.
