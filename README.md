Calculating Averages From Sensor Data
-------------------------------------

The goal of this effort is to produce a single output file from a series of different input files containing smartphone sensor data.  The output file calculates the average per variable per person for certain actvities that were measured.

The following steps were performed to calculate the average per variable per person per activity:


1. Prepare Input Files (Pre-Processing Step)

* The two input data-sets provided consisted of "test" data and "train" data.  
* Within each category (test and train), there are data from smartphone sensors, data from the activity performed and data related to the subject performing the action
* The data-sets were combined to create an inclusive data-set of sensor data, user data and activity data
